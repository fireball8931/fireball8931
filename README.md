# Michael Ross
## IT Learning Coach and IT Manager at Academy of Learning Career College since 2017

I mainly use this github account for college projects, like the campus website [aolccbc.com], integration and automation projects, as well as supporting my software design students￼￼.

### Main languages used:
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - PHP
  - Javascript
  - Python
  - Powershell
  - Linux Bash
  - Windows Batch
  
I'm always looking to learn more about programming, tech, security, best practices, learning and teaching techniques, and more. 

Most projects are bespoke, custom solutions, but when they don't contain secrets, I'll keep them public.
